    "iFoodProjectFullDescription":"This project was developed during the Front-End Development track of the Ada.Tech course. The objective of this exercise was to emulate a landing page for iFood, utilizing essential front-end development technologies such as HTML and CSS. Following a single-page structure, also known as SPA, the goal was to create a responsive layout that served as a foundation for fundamental development techniques. It is also important to highlight its static nature, as the exercise was carried out without the use of JavaScript in its implementation.",

    "chaveiroGelsonProjectFullDescription": "My first commercial project. Aimed at presenting the company's services. The project's proposal was, in addition to providing a business card for Chaveiro Gelson, with its offered services and location, to also provide a simple and efficient system for creating quotes. To do this, the WhatsApp API was used, where, through a card system, a customer visiting the page could build a well-structured quote, which would be submitted via the company's WhatsApp. The entire page manipulation was done using 'pure' JavaScript.",

    "toDoProject": "This project was developed as a group exercise during the Ada.Tech course...",
    "toDoProjectFullDescription": "This project was developed as a group exercise during the Ada.Tech course. During the dynamic front-end module, it was proposed that each trio develop a ToDo web app. In partnership with my colleagues Rodrigo Silva and Wild Barreto, we developed a simple system that, in addition to allowing task registration, also enables editing, completion, and deletion of tasks, with the differentiator of having persistent storage, using the browser's localStorage for data persistence.",

    "thisPortfolioProject": "(...) built not only to demonstrate the progression of my React skills...",
    "thisPortfolioProjectFullDescription": "My most recent project, this very page, was built not only to showcase the progression of my React skills but primarily to demonstrate other aspects that go beyond 'Lucas Developer.' In addition to a more advanced use of React, the page was built using libraries like typeIt, CSS animations, all to bring more dynamism. The CSS was entirely worked with styled components, and there was extensive use of contexts, both for page translation, styling, and even for presenting sections not directly related to my work as a developer. Additionally, great care was taken in working on the page's responsiveness, ensuring that it adapts to any type of screen.",

    "todoTrackerProject": "The To-do Tracker was the natural evolution of my previous work on to-do lists.", 
    "todoTrackerProjectFullDescription": "The To-do Tracker was the natural evolution of my previous work on to-do lists. In it, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in React while developing a useful tool to continue my studies as a developer. The idea behind this app is not only to organize task lists within their respective projects and/or works but also to track (manually) the time dedicated to each task. Additionally, it allows you to view the total time for a project/work by summing the time spent on each task. Lastly, and not less importantly, it is possible to make pricing estimations for the work and filter tasks by date, with the help of react-calendar.",

    "portfolioV01Project": "The old version of my portfolio was my first major attempt with React.",
    "portfolioV01ProjectFullDescription": "The old version of my portfolio was my first major attempt with React. At the time, my knowledge of the library was still very superficial, which led to frequent direct DOM manipulations using vanilla JavaScript. Nevertheless, I achieved a relatively satisfactory result in its construction. The project was originally hosted on GitHub Pages and was essentially structured as a single-page application, with navigation through section IDs.",

    "bgdProjectDetail2": "During the lockdown at home with my family, I began building a great collection. This, combined with visits to a local board game store (which became more frequent with the end of the pandemic), Cúpula do Trovão, was the perfect trigger for the creation of the 'BoardGameDay' event, which, with few exceptions, takes place once a month at the same store.",
    "bgdProjectDetail3": "The project is organized in partnership with my friend Luca and the store management, which provides the space for us to gather board game enthusiasts and also introduce the hobby to new players.",

This simple device lacked a heated bed or an emergency system to handle clogs, which later resulted in a serious motor failure.",
    "tesseractProjectDetail3": "Later, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Cúpula do Trovão (the same board game store mentioned earlier) in the development of RPG miniatures, using the Ender-3, one of the most popular entry-level 3D printers at the time.",
    "tesseractProjectDetail4": "At the same time, I also worked with a more advanced machine, the GT-Max3D H5 CORE, which featured a much larger print volume and an advanced interface for real-time print management. This experience came through a collaboration with my Architecture and Urbanism course, which had two key goals: to gain in-depth knowledge about the equipment so it could be passed on to future students, and to assess the feasibility of producing face shield frames for use during the pandemic.",
    "tesseractProjectDetail5": "The main result of this collaboration with the university was the opportunity to teach a workshop for students and professors at UFPel, demonstrating best practices and techniques for preparing models for 3D printing.",
