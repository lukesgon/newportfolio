The objective of this exercise was to emulate a landing page for iFood, utilizing essential front-end development technologies such as HTML and CSS. Following a single-page structure, also known as SPA, the goal was to create a responsive layout that served as a foundation for fundamental development techniques. It is also important to highlight its static nature, as the exercise was carried out without the use of JavaScript in its implementation."
